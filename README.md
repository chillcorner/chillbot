# Chill Bot

It was originally called "Chill Corner" bot just like any generic branded custom bot. It had basic moderation, fun and utlity commands that helped run our server. Many members of our community prefer to call it "Chill bot" so I renamed it

It always used to be a private bot and I could never make it open-source due to ugly and unreadable code that had more runtime errors than comments. Now I'm starting over from the scratch and making it public on github so others can contribute to new stuff or help improve my bad code. 

I plan to make this bot public one day or at least some parts of it. It's still a private bot with custom funcatinatlies suited to only our server but I may include some features that can be used by other server owners.
